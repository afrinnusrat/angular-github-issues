## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Installation of npm packages

Run `npm install`.

## Build

Run `ng build --aot` to build the project in AoT mode instead of JiT. This will allow for faster rendering of your application, Fewer asynchronous requests, Smaller Angular framework download size and to Detect template errors earlier.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
